                                    If these parameters stayed the same for 5 years, you'd be <b>£56,008 better off</b> if you chose to purchase rather than rent.
									We'll call this number the delta, where a positive value indicates the buyer is better off and a negative value indicates the renter is better off.

                                    <h1>Sensitivity Analysis</h1>
									<h2>One at a time</h2>

                                    What happens to the delta when we change each of the input variables in turn? All the other inputs stay at their baseline value.<br/>

                                    <iframe src="plots/1d-sensitivity.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

                                    If we take the first order derivative (slope) of each of these traces:<br/>

                                    <iframe src="plots/1d-sensitivity-slope.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
									
									We can see that the simulation's result (delta) is most sensitive to:
									<ul>
										<li><b class="red">Property value yearly increase</b>: each 1% pt increase results in the buyer being £5k-£17k better off</li>
										<li><b class="green">Mortgage interest rate</b>: each 1% pt increase results in the buyer being £8k-£10k worse off</li>
										<li><b class="purple">Initial monthly rent price</b>: each £100 increase results in the buyer being £7k better off.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Two at a time</h2>
									
									The previous anaysis changed just one variable at a time. The contour plots below show the effect on the delta when we change two variables.
									A positive delta (better to buy) is <b class="contourblue">blue</b> and a negative delta (better to rent) is <b class="contourred">red</b>.<br/>
									
									We'd normally expect the mortgage and savings interest rates to be linked (perhaps as an offset from the Bank of England's base rate).
									Here's how the <b class="green">mortgage interest rate</b> and <b class="cyan">savings interest rate</b> affect the simulation:
									
                                    <iframe src="plots/savingsInterestRate-mortgageInterestRate.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

									We can see that high interest rates (whether mortgage or savings) are bad for buying and good for renting.<br/>

									<hr/>

									For a buyer, we know that high <b class="green">mortgage interest rates</b> are bad and that high <b class="red">property value growth</b> is good.
									Let's see what the interplay between the two is and where the breakeven point is (i.e. where the delta is £0).

									<iframe src="plots/propertyValueYearlyIncrease-mortgageInterestRate.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

									<hr/>

									So far, we've assumed that the prospective buyer can borrow enough money for a <b class="blue">property valued</b> at £200,000 which is roughly equivalent to a <b class="purple">monthly rent</b> of £1,200.
									What are the results if the budget is reduced or stretched?
									The <b style="color: gray; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dashed;">grey dotted line</b> shows an approximate expected relationship between property values and rent prices.

									<iframe src="plots/initialPropertyValue-initialMonthlyRentPrice.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

									We can see that increasing or decreasing the budget results in a linear change to the delta. I.e. doubling the budget doubles the delta.

									<br/><br/>
									<h2>Three at a time</h2>

									Let's see how the delta is affected when we sweep through a range of values for the 3 most powerful variables:

									<ul>
										<li><b class="red">Property value yearly increase</b></li>
										<li><b class="green">Mortgage interest rate</b></li>
										<li><b class="purple">Initial monthly rent price</b></li>
									</ul>

									Like with the 2D contour plots, a positive delta (better to buy) is <b class="contourblue">blue</b> and a negative delta (better to rent) is <b class="contourred">red</b>.

									<b style="color: rgb(49, 76, 101);">+£300k</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(30, 124, 177);">+£200k</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(158, 204, 223);">+£100k</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">£0</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(250, 176, 150);">-£100k</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(197, 54, 58);">-£200k</b>, 
									<b style="color: rgb(97, 0, 29);">-£300k</b>.
